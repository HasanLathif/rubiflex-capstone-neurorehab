## 1. The Problem
Brachial Plexus Injury (BPI) often leads to partial or total arm paralysis, and recovery requires long-term, intensive rehabilitation. Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is a key therapy, but existing devices are often expensive, non-intuitive, or require constant clinical supervision, which limits at-home recovery.

## 2. Our Solution

Our team (Kelompok 7) is developing **RUBIflex**, an affordable, IoT-enabled neurorehabilitation system designed for automated motor recovery. The system uses FES to stimulate arm muscles, while an ESP32 microcontroller manages the stimulation patterns. The device is controlled by a simple web-based dashboard, allowing therapists to set up and monitor therapy remotely.

## 3. My Role & Key Contributions

I am the **Person in Charge (PIC) of Electrical, IoT Control, and Webpage** for this team project.

* **Current Status:**
    * Designed the complete electrical system architecture and component layout.
    * Wrote the initial `C++` (Arduino/ESP32) code for FES signal generation.
    * Developed the first version of the web-based dashboard for IoT control.
    * Designed the custom PCB (currently ordered for manufacturing).
* **Responsibilities:**
    * All hardware wiring and component integration.
    * All firmware development for the ESP32.
    * Finalizing the web dashboard and IoT communication.
    * System troubleshooting and testing.

## 4. Technology Stack

* **Programming Languages:** `C++` (for hardware), `JavaScript` / `HTML` / `CSS` (for web)
* **Hardware:** `ESP32`, `FES Electrodes`, `Custom PCB`, `Relay/Driver Circuits`
* **Software & Tools:** `Arduino IDE`, `KiCad` / `EasyEDA`, `PlatformIO`, `GitHub`

## 5. Project Status

**Status: [Ongoing]**
*This is my active capstone project. The PCB has been designed and ordered, and the whole integration is in progress.*
